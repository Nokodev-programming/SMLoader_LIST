# SMLoader Database

Welcome to the database github repo of SMLoader. In here all verified mods and etc are stored. Why? That's because (When it gets released) you have to each time redownload it just to update the database. This reduces the owner (NokoDev) to update the database. Now this is Free And smart idea. No wonder why the owner has to entirly make a server just for a database.

## For all mod developers:
You can upload your mod to the Database. Just that i needs requriements and verification The requriements are `Mod must be reviewed AND used in a populair youtube channel`, `Mod needs around 30K Subscribers`. Onces that you can create a Issue (Issues are used for uploading mods and verify them. That's how it works for THIS repo.). Your issue sould look like this:
```
MOD ID: <Insert your mod id showned in the workshop folder)
MOD Name: <Insert your mod's title
MOD Reason: <Insert the reason why you want it to be added>
MOD Description:
<Insert your mod description. This gives NokoDev some understanding of what it can be used for. We don't want to add mods that are worthless or stupid>



Mod Link: <Insert the mod link from steam. (Add "steam://openurl/" to the beggining making a link that opens steam app. This makes it bit faster for NokoDev to test before finishing it up>
Mod Developers: <Insert the developers that made your mod. The higher, The better chances)
```
The schedule is random so Luck is needed if you want a fast time.

Onces NokoDev starts reading the issues and dose the verification and its your turn, The role "Verifing" role gets added. if you added this by your self then you will be denied instanly. The Mod Link, ID, Reason and Developers are important as you can see before. NokoDev will then message you if you applied the selected mod. Attempting to verify a mod that is not from you will be a denied. Doing this more will cause you to be in a blacklist meaning your github account cannot apply any mods to it more. This is how the verification system is done. If you where to reply to the message (On Steam) that it is true then your mod is sucessfully added to the database.

These are the roles showned:
Denied: The mod is denied for a spefic reason
Accepted: The mod is accepted.
Other: For other reasons to make post a issue
DMCA: Please use this if your mod got duplicated and got posted to the steam workshop and SMLoader database. (This is possible but NokoDev dosen't know if this will work. else this gets applied to only to spefic mods that are populair and verified.
