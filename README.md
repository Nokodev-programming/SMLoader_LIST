# SMLoader_LIST

This is a database for the SMLoader Project. Because it won't be great if you have to each time redownload this (When it gets released).

If your a mod developer and created a mod that's populair AND a populair youtuber has posted a video of it then you can call a Pull request and NokoDev will verify it. Order to successfully verify it NokoDev will send a message claming if you want the selected mod to be verified. This prevents from people verifing a mod that they don't own.

Your pull request needs to look like this:
```
MOD ID: <Insert your mod id showned in the workshop folder)
MOD Name: <Insert your mod's title

MOD Description:
<Insert your mod description. This gives NokoDev some understanding of what it can be used for. We don't want to add mods that are worthless or stupid>



Mod Link: <Insert the mod link from steam. (Add "steam://openurl/" to the beggining making a link that opens steam app. This makes it bit faster for NokoDev to test before finishing it up>
Mod Developers: <Insert the developers that made your mod. The higher, The better chances)
```
